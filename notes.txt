<stdio.h> is a header file library that allows the use of simple input and output functons

The name given to a variable is called an identifier


char - 1 byte - %c
int - 2/4 bytes no decimals - %d/%i
float - 4 bytes 6-7 dp - %f
double - 8 bytes up to 15 dp - %lf

string - %s 

Type Conversion

- This is changing from one data type to another. It can be implicit or automatic e.g when you declare an int data type but provide a float value (the float val is automatically converted to an integer). Explicit you specify the data type you want it to be my specifying it in parentheses

Operators; arithmetic, assignment, bitwise, comparison, logical

increment operator can be used before or after the variable 

^ (X0R), << (left shift), >> (right shift), & (and), | (or)


Strings are a sequence of characters terminated by a null terminator at the end \0
So basically a string with 5 characters actually takes up 6 spaces in the memory because of the extra \0 character. Strings are always enclosed in double quotes.

char name[no] = "String";
and they are accessed using %s

The assignment operator can only be used on strings when declaring the string. Strings can still be assigned values by scanf

NOTE:
1. In C now you have to declare the number of characters for the string first if you're not going to assign the value immediately
2. The & reference operator for assigning to a var is unnecessary allow
