Write constants in capital letters

Characters are always represented in single quoted

Booleans include <stdbool.h>
Booleans can only be returned as integers

Arrays are defined with square brackets optionally having the number of elements of the array after the name 
the array is initialised based on the types of values it stored and when it is created in one line; the array elements are put in curly braces
Arrays can also be created by declaring the array and the number of items and assigning each item it's value after

Strings
In c, a string is just an array of characters. It is declared using the same array syntax but the type is char and the value is the text in double quotes
It can also be created by creating an actual array of chars with a terminating value at the end of it. The string similarly to arrays can be updated through indexing
